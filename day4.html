<h1>DAY 4</h1>
<p>
    19 July 6:30 ish pm <br>
    im just having fun. the realisation i had is, there is so much stuff i <strong>WANT</strong> to do right, so no matter what your state of mind is, there is 
    always <strong>something</strong> i can do. So, at every single moment, im just going to do that. <br>
    I woke up at 5:15 ish? Mummy had come back to Meerut, this is my last weekend of summer. Last two days. I wanna build a winning habit right here. <br>
    These two days I want to work my hardest before going back to IIT. <br>
    So, anyways, I was kinda tired so I decided to do apostol (analytic nt) ch.2 excercies (I had done this in 11th grade, this is ig a revision of sorts) <br>
    One thing w me is, I have a reallyyyyy big ego. I really believe I can do anything, so if there is something I am not able to do, I find it very tough to move
    forward. Like there was this excercise, which basically said, prove \sigma_1 = \phi * \sigma_0 ... here sigma_i(n) is sum of ith powers of all divisors
    of n, so like sigma_0 is the no. of divisors, sigma_1 is sum of divisors and so on. I mean this was easy, but then they had also asked for a generalisation
    of this result for all \sigma_a. And like last night, when i was trying to do this, i couldnt do it at all, and that annoyed me and when i skipped this problem,
    i couldnt think  about the problems ahead of this either... <br>
    But right now, i thought, ok maybe my stubornness is a good thing, and so i just thought about this problem, realised I could look at the bell series!!! <br>
    And I mean when i looked at the bell series, I just realised, \sigma_k= J_k * sigma_0 where J_k is the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%27s_totient_function">generalised totient function</a> . <br>
    Cool as hell man. <br>
    1:20 am <br>
    Then i mean nothing really special happened, i talked to Sagnik, btw this sem, ive just taken completely random math/cs courses. I mean I already know
    for a fact im going to drop out of IIT Delhi, but shit like this just makes it official. <br>
    <img src="courses name" width="800" height="600"> <br>
    Im kinda excited about the AI class, I really am the smartest kid man, lets go have fun... <br>
    Then I was on call with Harsh, Venky and Daksh (IIT Delhi friends) and they were telling me about their club story or wtv, it was so funny, but it just 
    furthered my disinterest in ts, i really can not give a fuck about anything but being the best in this world. That's really it man, lets just go have fun. <br>
    btw one thing i know for sure, is the confidence will come from living out my dreams every single day!!! Just me at my table, studying cool shit all day, thats
    literally the dream. thats all im doing :D. <br> 
    Not only do I wanna have fun doing math and programming, i wanna be different man. I wanna be the definition of locked in. when kids in the future look back
    they should really be like damn this is what it took to be the best. and like feel inspired. cos I know, when i look at some cool people, and i see that they
    don't work hard or have distractions, i feel dissapointed, but wtv, thats their life, i wanna show ppl what happens when you truly love something and are 
    very curiours and have a god level of self belief. and are locked in beyond normalcy. even when i have billions of dollars, i will never change. and thats a 
    mony promise ;) lets fucking go man, witness history right here lmaoooooo, now enough of this emotional non sense, lets go be the best ever now. <br>
    2 am <br>
    fun asl, im listening to cool songs doing math fully focused. letsgooo... i did one of the toughest apostol problems. <br>
    <img src="apostol p 30,31" width="800" height="600"> <br>
    Really cool solution, for the hint case, i fix a and then induct on b < a... Really cool idea, and then you just use multiplicative magic for the general case
    <br>
    I looked up my grade 11 notebook, and i had basically the same idea. man,like no glaze, i really am one of the smartest kids itw. i really dont gaf man. <br>
    like smmc (asian putnam) on paper 1 i got 21, which is essentially the 2nd highest score in asia over multiple imo medallists... this year at smmc im going
    to get the highest score in asia, by the end of the year i'll do the whole usa tst cycle and be imo gold leval, and usaco plat highest score too. im just 
    really built different, in lucknow, when i started math, i didnt know anything, but i just worked my way, and off like not that much work, i became one of the 
    best in the world (13th in india in inmo off a very bad exam)(26/42 on elmo 2023, imo silver level score ) <br>
    I really believe there is nothing in this world i cant do. I really got crazy potential man. You gotta do this shit justice, im basically wemby of this world. 
    <br>
    im just enjoying this journey man, and yall get to witness greatness :D <br>
    btw i had a really cool idea, so like yk im taking the AI class, the prof seems really cool (finally a cool iitd person lmao). this will be fun, i think a 
    cool thing i can do will be <strong>break hinge's facial recognition</strong>. ok so the idea is, im perma banned on hinge, like face banned on hinge cos of
    a prank that i did, so like they use surely a facial detection thing right, so what is the minimal changes/tranformations i can make to my photots so that it
    passes hinge's facial recognition. I mean this is such a fun idea, i really dont give a fuck about hoes, its just this is the kind of viralish idea That
    ive always wanted to work on. cool math that gives me notoreity. by the end of this sem, i will do this :D. lets fucking go mane, back to work. when im working
    hard im soooo inspired. <br>
    3 am <br>
    did a fewmore problems then took a small break, posted a couple tweets. i looked at a couple of my old blogger blogs. now can't hold us is playing, lets get
    back to work :D <br>
    4 am <br>
    well apostol chapter 2 is done... ig when i just sit down and decide to focus, im actually efficient as fuck... lets keep going, i feel like doing crypto rn,
    well imma "revise" chapter 1 of intro to mathematical crypto [silverman] and also crypto 101 and do some of the problems worth doing. woohoo. no breaks pls!!!
    <br>
    4:40 ish <br>
    I just came back from a scooty ride, and im ready to have fun and work right here :D <br>
    I studied pretty deep into the night, completely did intro to mathematicalcrypto ch 1... it was just a light revision hoenstly since ive already done this 
    earlier but still, then i slept. <br>
    11:20 ish pm 20 July <br>
