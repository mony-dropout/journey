//lagrange interpolation
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
//calculate pi (x-ai)
//horner
//divide by linear
//this gives you lagrange interpolation in O(n^2), but how to get the coefficient form from that is the question...
//i mean its not a tough question lol cos im already storing polynomials as vectors lmao
//ok so vector v[i] is poly p=\sum v[i]x^i
